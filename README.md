# Nature-Inspired Algorithms
This repository contains the source code for the algorithms we implemented to solve the assigned projects of this seminar.

### Project 1
The task was to compare the run times of Random Local Search and 1+λ EA for different pseudo-boolean fitness functions. [Report](https://github.com/lawben/nature17/blob/master/project1/Benson-Gierke-Ring.pdf)

### Project 2
The goal was to analyze the run times of 1+1 EA for the fitness functions LeadingOnes and Jump_k. [Report](https://github.com/lawben/nature17/blob/master/project2/Benson-Gierke-Ring.pdf)

### Project 3
This very practical project was about solving big TSP problems using Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. [Report](https://github.com/lawben/nature17/blob/master/project3/documentation/Benson-Gierke-Ring.pdf)

### Project 4
In the last project we applied our theoretical knowledge to another real-world problem. We searched for assignments of students to teams such that the teams are as diverse as possible concerning sex, major and nationality. [Report](https://github.com/lawben/nature17/blob/master/project4/documentation/Benson-Gierke-Ring-REPORT.pdf)
